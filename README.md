## Project
This project serves as the implementation of algorithms being studied by Jonathan Zwiebel at the NASA Ames Astrophysics Branch on algorithmic asteroid detection and tracking. The process for asteroid analysis being studied is broken down into three steps: loation, filtering, and tracking, all of which are covered in this project. This code serves as an interface for researchers to run parameterized algorithms over large sets of data. The research associated with this code is Jonathan's project for the 2015 - 2016 Science Research Projects class at Palo Alto High School.
